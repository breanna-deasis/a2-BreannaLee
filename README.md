Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  


## Bree's To-Do List
This is a to do list website with a 45 minute focus timer. Tasks and their due dates can be added and edited in line. There is also a temporary note section for distraction notes and priority focus. They don't get saved because they are meant to be reset and used for each focus session, but are very helpful to stay on track. I use a list to display tasks, and flex columns to separate each functionality (timer, task list, and notes)

## Technical Achievements
- **Adding tasks + calculating priority tasks**: When tasks are added, they are updated in the server-side and due dates are subtracted from the current date to derive which tasks are overdue or due today. These updates are appended to the task list on the client side. 

- **Modifying data**: tasks and their due dates can be edited in line which triggers the function to update the data saved in the backend. When the page is reloaded or tasks are reprinted, these changes will still remain

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Instructions:**: Add a task, start the focus timer, then edit the due date
