## Bree's To-Do List
This is a to-do list dashboard with a 45 minute focus timer, and temporary reflection box. Tasks and their due dates can be added and edited in line. There is also a temporary note section for distraction notes and priority focus. They don't get saved because they are meant to be reset and used for each focus session, but are very helpful to stay on track. I use a list to display tasks, and flex columns to separate each functionality (timer, task list, and notes)

## Technical Achievements
- **Adding tasks + calculating priority tasks**: When tasks are added, they are updated in the server-side
- **Calculating Overdue Tasks**: Due dates are subtracted from the current date to derive which tasks are overdue or due today. These updates are appended to the task list on the client side. 
- **Modifying data**: Task names and their due dates can be edited in line which triggers the function to update the data saved in the backend. When the page is reloaded or tasks are reprinted, these changes will still remain

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Instructions for Angela:**: Add a task, start the focus timer, then edit the due date
- It was straight forward to use and the color palette was satisfying
- The width of the boxes are a little awkward, and it would nice if there was a visual tracker of how much time was spent focusing, and a way to star or label which task was being worked on during the session
- Based on observation and feedback, I'll definitely change the styling and contrast of elements to make it more accessible eg. making the delete task button smaller and a darker color, and changing the font of tasks. It looks great for labels and even the text placeholders, but I can imagine it being hard to read. I would also like to add the option to save and display the notes rather than have them temporary. If not, then at least a saveable reflection after a focus session that saves to a log.
